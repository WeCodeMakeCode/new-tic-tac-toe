This is an unbeatable (I think) Tic-Tac-Toe game. It does not use the minimax algorithm. Rather, since tic-tac-toe is such a simple game, this program demonstrates an adhoc, easy-to-follow algorithm that does not use recursion. Yes, it was invented by the author, although certainly it has been used before by others because the computer plays using the same logic that an experienced human player uses.  The game features the following types of play: player against computer where the computer makes its best move, player against computer where the computer makes a random mode and computer (best or random) against computer (best or random)
